	    	    		<p>First of all, TeamSnap is for the overworked person who's in charge of your recreational adult sports team or youth sports team. (You know who you are.) Coaches, managers, parents, and anybody else who's been tapped to keep track of your sports team. TeamSnap gives this person their life back.</p>
	    	    		<p>But most of all, TeamSnap is for the team because it enables your teammates to communicate, coordinate, and collaborate in ways that are both fun and time-saving. Bottom line, TeamSnap puts the enjoyment back into team sports.</p>

	    	    	<div class="sixteen columns add-top">
	    	    		<p>Nope! Just switch your team site to the Free Plan during the off season. You don't pay anything but still have all your team data 100% saved. When a new season starts, you just reactivate your team and are ready to roll.</p>
